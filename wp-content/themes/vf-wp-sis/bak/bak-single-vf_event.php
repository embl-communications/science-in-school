                        <p><strong>EMBL is committed to sharing research advances and sustaining scientific interaction
                                throughout the coronavirus pandemic. We are delighted to announce that the course is
                                going

                        <p>Regulation of translation is a key layer in the control of gene expression, playing a
                            critical role in many biological and pathophysiological settings. In the last decade,
                            methodological advances have provided comprehensive insights into cellular transcriptomes
                            and proteomes, however, the systems-wide analysis of translation has remained an unsolved
                            experimental challenge. The recent advent of ‘ribosome-profiling’ has provided the
                            methodological basis for comprehensive transcriptome-wide analyses of translation at
                            sub-codon resolution by the precise and high-throughput determination of ribosomal positions
                            on mRNA. Its application in a variety of organisms yielded novel insights into protein
                            synthesis and its dynamic regulation, significantly advancing our understanding of the
                            post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This practical course will combine
                            theoretical sessions with hands-on experimentation and computation emphasising the key steps
                            of the protocol and computational quality control.</p>

                            <p>This grant covers costs related to your attendance to the course (registration, travel
                                and accommodation costs). The grant is restricted to PhD students and postdocs who
                                conduct basic biomedical research.<br>Whether you are eligible to apply for a travel
                                grant,&nbsp;depends on when you received your university entrance qualification (e.g.
                                Abitur, A-Levels, High School Diploma, Final State Examination):</p>


                            <p>– for PhD and MD students, as well as graduates, the university entrance qualification
                                must not have been obtained more than 11 years ago at the time of the envisaged

                            <h3><strong>Application</strong></h3>


                            <p>Applications for financial assistance can be submitted via the submission portal* (for
                                the submission of abstracts for conferences or the submission of motivation letters for
                                courses) by completing the Financial Assistance Application Section (underneath the
                                section for entering abstract/motivation letter information). The link to the portal can
                                be found in the registration confirmation email that you will receive after registering
                                for the conference or course.</p>


                            <p>For conferences, if you are not submitting an abstract, you can still apply for financial
                                assistance in the submission portal by following the instructions&nbsp;<a
                                        href="https://www.embl.de/training/events/info_participants/fellowships/FA_instructions.pdf"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Note that priority will be
                                given to those submitting an abstract to present at the conference. In your application
                                you will be asked to answer questions regarding your motivation for applying, and, for
                                registration fee waivers, the reasons why your lab cannot fund your attendance and how
                                your attendance will make a difference to your career. Application for financial support
                                will not affect the outcome of your registration application.</p>


                            <p>*For some events, applications for Childcare Grants will still be done by email.
                                Information about the grant will be sent out shortly after the abstract/motivation
                                letter deadline. Please contact the event Conference Officer if you have any
                                questions.</p>


                            <h3><strong>Selection</strong></h3>


                            <p>The scientific organisers will select the recipients of registration fee waivers during
                                the abstract selection process for conferences and the participant selection process for
                                courses.&nbsp;Results will be announced approximately 3 – 4 weeks before the event start
                                date.&nbsp;Selection results do not impact your admission to the meeting. Registration
                                fee waiver selection is based on your current work or study location, your motivation
                                for applying, the reasons for needing financial support and the impact this event will
                                have on your career. Childcare grants are allocated based on career stage, with priority
                                given to early stage researchers.</p>

                            <p>It is important to stay healthy and move around, especially when you are attending an
                                event virtually. We have put together a few coffee break stretches and yoga videos in
                                the events Slack workspace for you to enjoy during the event.</p>


                            <h2 id="questions">How to ask questions</h2>


                            <p>Questions during and after the talks can be asked in live streaming platform. The chair
                                moderates the questions and shares them with the speaker. If time runs out or you think
                                of a question later, you can use Slack to ask your questions in the dedicated session
                                channels or via direct message.</p>


                            <h2 id="time">Time zone</h2>


                            <p>The programme is planned based on Central European Time (CET), unless otherwise stated.
                                As many virtual participants are attending from around the world, we do our best to
                                accomodate as many timezones as possible when creating the programme. Please take your
                                time zone into consideration when planning your attendance.</p>
